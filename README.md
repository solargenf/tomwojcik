# starlette context
Middleware for Starlette (and FastAPI) that allows you to store and access request data, like correlation id or metadata.

### Why I have created it

I use FastAPI. I needed something that will allow me to log with context data. Right now I can just `log.info('Message')` and I have log (in ELK) with request id and correlation id. I don't even think about passing this data to logger. It's there automatically.
  
    


Minimal example from `examples/simple_examples/set_context_in_middleware.py` dir:

```python
import uvicorn
from starlette.applications import Starlette
from starlette.requests import Request
from starlette.routing import Route
from starlette.responses import JSONResponse
from starlette_context import PreserveCustomContextMiddleware, get_context


async def index(request: Request):
    return JSONResponse(get_context())  # <-- we get context (dict)


routes = [
    Route('/', index)
]

app = Starlette(debug=True, routes=routes)
app.add_middleware(PreserveCustomContextMiddleware)  # we set context with some data
uvicorn.run(app)
```

Returns JSONResponse with data from context, such as RequestID.
Context can be updated and accessed at anytime if it's created in the middleware.
