# starlette-context
Middleware for Starlette (and FastAPI) that allows you to store and access request data, like correlation id or metadata.


There are a few github tickets related to this:
https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/issues/397
https://github.com/encode/starlette/issues/420


I followed the examples and there it is.

All tickets or PRs are more than welcome.
